# readme-ready-node

This application was built for devlopers who are creating open source projects on GitHub! It's important to include readmes for your project, but sometimes it's easy to forget what to put in them. Instead of taking the time to tediously create a markdown for your readme, this app allows you to answer simple prompts in the command-line. The app will prompt you for required information (your project name, description, and contact information), and gives you optional criteria to include (what your app is for/how to use your app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions).

ReadMe-ready-node is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Built with javaScript and node.js.
