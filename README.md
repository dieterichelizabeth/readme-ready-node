# readme-ready-node

ReadMe-ready-node is a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md file from the user's input. It's important to include readmes for your project, but sometimes it's easy to forget what to put in them. Instead of taking the time to tediously create a markdown for your readme, this app allows you to answer simple prompts in the command-line. Readme-Ready-Node will prompt you for required information (your project name, description, and contact information), and gives you optional criteria to include (what your app is for/how to use your app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions).

Built with JavaScript, Node.js, and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
