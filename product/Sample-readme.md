# workday-timetable
 
Workday timetable is simple calendar app that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app keeps track of time by changing the colors of the "taskbox" as each hour passes. Users can update tasks by double clicking on the task box itself, entering the task for that time, and clicking the "save" button. The app stores user input, so users can close the page and return to check their schedules throughout the day.Workday timetable also allows users to quickly re-set their schedules each day by pressing the "New Day!" button at the top of the screen. This will clear the tasks in your timetable for a fresh start. üçÉ
